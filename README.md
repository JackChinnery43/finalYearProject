My final year project at university - not yet finished

This application looks at the effectiveness of machine learning at predicting future Bitcoin market prices. The application takes two Python files, one for historical Bitcoin finanical market data, and another for historical tweets relating to Bitcoin. The data is cleaned and combined in order to be fed into machine learning algorithms.

The Twitter data consists of 16 million tweets relating to Bitcoin, and a sentiment score is extracted using the natural language processing library VADER, in order to evalute whether there is a relationship between public sentiment and the Bitcoin close market price on any given day.

The final project will be delpoyed via a Streamlit Python web application, enabling users to experiment with feature selection in the models, and view the model predictions on an interactive chart.

I will update this readme file with the link to the Streamlit application once my project is submitted, at the latest on the 21st May 2021.
